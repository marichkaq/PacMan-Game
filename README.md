# PacMan-Game
GUI Pacman Game in Java (SWING)

Welcome to the Pacman-Style Game Project repository! This project involves creating an engaging game with a graphical user interface, inspired by the classic Pacman game. The game features enemies, upgrades, a scoring system, and much more.

Project Overview:

Game Features:
* Enemies that have a 25% chance to create upgrades every 5 seconds.
* Five different significant complex upgrades for the player to collect.
* Fully functional graphical interface with main menu options: New Game, High Scores, and Exit.
* Customizable game board size (10 to 100 rows/columns) displayed using the JTable component.
* Maze generation based on the chosen size by the user, creating a unique game board for each playthrough.
* Real-time updated score counter, time counter, life counter, and other UI elements during gameplay.
* Graphics files for visual elements and simple animations for game characters.
* High Scores persistence using the Serializable interface.

Technologies Used:

Java Swing for the graphical user interface.
JTable component for displaying the game board.
Custom AbstractTableModel for the game board.
Multithreading with the Thread class for game timing and animations.
Serializable interface for saving and loading high scores.

Use the keyboard to navigate and control the player.
Press Ctrl+Shift+Q at any time to return to the main menu.

This project was a great learning experience, and I learned a lot from it. Through this project, I gained practical experience using  modern Java features such as inheritance, collections, interfaces, abstract classes, and lambda expressions.
Looking back, I see many areas where I could improve and apply more advanced techniques now. This project was done at the very start of my learning journey, and it laid a solid foundation for my continued growth in software development.
